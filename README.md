## Hypergraphs with Edge-Dependent Vertex Weights: Spectral Clustering based on the 1-Laplacian

The code for the paper "Hypergraphs with Edge-Dependent Vertex Weights: Spectral Clustering based on the 1-Laplacian" by Yu Zhu, Boning Li and Santiago Segarra.

#### Datasets

We adopt two datasets: 20 Newsgroups and covtype.

The code of preprocessing 20 Newsgroups can be found in the file "python".

For the usage of covtype, refer to the following link:

#### To reproduce the results in our paper

Run "main_20news.m" and "main_covtype.m" to reproduce the results in Fig.1.

We use the code downloaded from the following link as a subroutine.
